Other comments: 

I'm particular proud of:


## Project grading 

No html description.
The application starts but swallows errors, e.g. when creating a new
question and then trying to add answers to it.

The functionality is a bit questionable but the engineering is overall ok.
Some more tests would have helped.

I award two extra points for using the Grails service abstraction and
the use of Web MVC, incl. view templates.

Total grade: 5.1
